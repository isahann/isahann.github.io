  I'm a software developer, finished my Analysis and Systems Development degree in 2018, and my
  Java specialization post-degree in 2022.

  <br /><br />
  I've been working with software development since mid-2016, when i started my first internship.

  <br /> <br />
  My work has been focused on developing most of the time, and partially aiding in
  technical/requirment analysis and testing back-end systems development, mainly using Java and
  its technologies.
